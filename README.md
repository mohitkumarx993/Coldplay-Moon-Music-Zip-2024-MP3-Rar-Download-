Coldplay has always overflowed with earnestness, and that desire to hug the world has only amplified as singer Chris Martin and his kindred spirit bandmates march deeper into middle age.

“Moon Music,” the band’s 10th studio album that arrives Friday, is lush and dreamy and ethereal and all of the words expected when describing Coldplay’s music.

It’s also contemplative and sweet – very, very sweet – as Martin, 47, tosses love bombs on nearly every track (he's been linked to Dakota Johnson since 2017). That is, when he isn’t sharing a poignant piano melody and pondering life in simple, yet effective terms.

Coldplay (from left) – Guy Berryman, Will Champion, Jonny Buckland and Chris Martin – release the dreamy new album "Moon Music" on Friday.
“Maybe I’m just crazy/ I should be a brick in the wall/ Sit and watch the TV, blame everyone else for it all/ But I’m trying to trust in the heavens above/ And I’m trying to trust in a world full of love,” he sings on the title track that opens the album.
